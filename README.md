# Finova Cybersecurity - Task 2: Learning Commands  #

:wave:
Welcome to the __Cyber Security__ Domain!

For the __first__ task, you installed a Linux distro and set it up.

For your __second task__, you will:

- Learn how to navigate Linux using commands.

_"Why do we need to use commands?"_ 

__Once you get the hang of it, using commands to navigate through your desktop will be much, much faster (and convenient!)__ 

Not to mention, as you participate in _CTFs_ or _Bug Bounties_, knowledge of linux commands will be necessary to be __competent.__

__With that being said, it doesnt have to be a boring process!__
