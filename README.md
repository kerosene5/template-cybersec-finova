# Finova Cyber Security - Summer #
 
üëã Hey there! Welcome once again to Finova Cybersec!

## __Goal__ ##
The goal for this task is to __learn__ the basics of cybersecurity - it's different domains and what they do, along with __practicing__ techniques used in those domains.


## __Choose__ ##
__Cyber Security__ in essence is split into _two_ broad categories: __Red Teaming__ and __Blue Teaming.__

### üî¥ **Red Teaming** means you are on the __offensive.__
- You think like a __hacker__ and try to __break__ into systems.
- Use __skills__ like penetration testing, social engineering, and exploit development.

 ### üîµ **Blue Teaming** means you are on the **defensive.**
- You __protect__ systems and __detect__ threats.
- __Monitor__ networks, analyze incidents, and __respond__ to attacks.

So, for this task, you have to __choose__ between which side interests you!

__You can even do both if you want to!__

---

## üî¥ Option 1:  ‡§π‡•à‡§ï‡§∞ 

As you probably guessed, this task will revolve around __CTF challenges__ and learning __red teaming__ techniques!

Each challenge has been __categorized__ into __5__ domains.

__Choose any 2 domains you like and complete their challenges.__
