# Finova Cyber Security - Summer #
 
üëã Hey there! Welcome once again to Finova Cybersec!

## __Goal__ ##
The goal for this task is to __learn__ the basics of cybersecurity - it's different domains and what they do, along with __practicing__ techniques used in those domains.


## __Choose__ ##
__Cyber Security__ in essence is split into _two_ broad categories: __Red Teaming__ and __Blue Teaming.__

### üî¥ **Red Teaming** means you are on the __offensive.__
- You think like a __hacker__ and try to __break__ into systems.
- Use __skills__ like penetration testing, social engineering, and exploit development.

 ### üîµ **Blue Teaming** means you are on the **defensive.**
- You __protect__ systems and __detect__ threats.
- __Monitor__ networks, analyze incidents, and __respond__ to attacks.

So, for this task, you have to __choose__ between which side interests you!

__You can even do both if you want to!__

---

## üî¥ Option 1:  ‡§π‡•à‡§ï‡§∞ 

As you probably guessed, this task will revolve around __CTF challenges__ and learning __red teaming__ techniques!

Each challenge has been __categorized__ into __5__ domains.

__Choose any 2 domains you like and complete their challenges.__

### Bonus: ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud
1. __Go__ to this site: http://flaws.cloud/
2. Try to solve their challenges. They're based on common vulnerabilities specific to __Amazon Web Services (AWS)__


__Again, you have to choose 2 domains and complete them. You can do more than that if you want to as well!__

__And thats all for Option 1!__

## üîµ Option 2: CISO

So, you want to learn how big corporations handle security? Well, most of their focus is on __defenses__ i.e __blue teaming.__

First of all, __Cyber Security__ on the __*industry*__ level is majorly categorized into __4__ fields (as of now).
                                                              
<img width="880" alt="{04E0CE2F-7813-4EF2-8D32-93C936B5FDCE}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8493fd44-df80-4c1b-93d4-bf5fc39792a2" />

<img width="739" alt="{B095119A-6709-4E33-BA96-0B0D078B1AC6}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e22f6a-56ca-43e4-a6c5-2efd0603bc2b" />


__"Why is the first thing networks?"__ you may ask. 

Well, that is for one simple reason - the whole of IT infrastructure (and thus cybersecurity) is built upon one thing - __networks__.

So, if you don't have __atleast__ a basic understanding of networks - it will be __very hard__ for you to progress forward.

1. __Go__ to [this](https://app.letsdefend.io/training/lessons/network-fundamentals) link. Make an Account.
2. __Complete__ the __Network Fundamentals__ course.

If you'd like to go more in-depth into __Networking__, please do watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ) playlist. It covers almost everything in networking, right from the scratch!

Also, if you are pursuing a career in cybersec, you may want to look into getting a __certification__ like the __CompTIA Network+__ or the __CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate).__  

Certifications can be very __valuable__, provided they are __reputed.__

An organization's security is usually handled by __SOCs - Security Operation Centers__

If you want to work in an organization's __SOC Team__, usually you would join in an entry level position such as a __L1 SOC Analyst.__

1. __Go__ to [this](https://app.letsdefend.io/training/lessons/soc-fundamentals) link.
2. __Complete__ the __SOC Fundamentals__ course.

You should be familiar with all the basic terminology and tools used in SOCs after finishing this course!
