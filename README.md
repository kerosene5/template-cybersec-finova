# Finova Cybersecurity - Task 2: Learning Commands  #

:wave:
Welcome to the __Cyber Security__ Domain!

For the __first__ task, you installed a Linux distro and set it up.

For your __second task__, you will:

- Learn how to navigate Linux using commands.

_"Why do we need to use commands?"_ 

__Once you get the hang of it, using commands to navigate through your desktop will be much, much faster (and convenient!)__ 

Not to mention, as you participate in _CTFs_ or _Bug Bounties_, knowledge of linux commands will be necessary to be __competent.__

__With that being said, it doesnt have to be a boring process!__

## Step 1: Create an account on pwn.college ##

- Go to [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/)

- Create an account.

## Step 2: Connect via SSH
- __Open__ your Linux Terminal.

- __Run: `ssh-keygen -f key -N ''`__

This will generate files `key` and `key.pub`, which are your _private_ and _public_ keys respectively.

- __Run: `cat key.pub`.__ The cat command will display the contents of the `key.pub` file to you.

- __Copy the contents of `key.pub`__
  
- Go to the __Settings__ tab in pwn.college. Then head over to the __SSH key__ section.

- Paste `key.pub` in the __SSH Key__ section.

- __Run: `ssh -i key hacker@pwn.college`.__ Type __yes__ when prompted.

## Step 3: Linux Luminarium

- On [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/), click on __Dojos__.

- Head to the __Linux Luminarium__ Dojo.

- Complete the __first 6 modules (Till Practicing Piping)__


__Note:__ You can also use pwn.college's __GUI Desktop Workspace__ to solve challenges (If you dont want to connect via SSH).

## Submission

- Create __writeups (in this repo)__ for each challenge, __with the flag (and how you got the flag)__

For example:

Module 1.md

```
Module 1: Hello Hackers

Intro To Commands

Flag: pwn.college{89T2ov5QdYyikKlBF9wnlLpPBG6.ddjNyUDL0QjN5YzW}

Solution: I typed "hello" in the terminal and got the flag.

```

You can also include pictures to explain in more detail.

__If you have already created writeups for the modules, just post the link to the github repository where you wrote them!__

Good Luck! If you have any doubts, feel free to message me or in the groupchat!
